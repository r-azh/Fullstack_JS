# Fullstack_JS
Fullstack javascript based on https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents


 
New approach to learning this:

1- Ask cursor to summarise the chapter in `Readme_cursor.md`

Can you summarize the steps in this link:
  https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4/structure_of_backend_application_introduction_to_testing
  inside the above pathc

 like the ones that I did for the previews parts in Readme.md files, into a new Readme_cursor.md. Add file names to all code blocks in Readme_cursor.md. If the folder/file structure doesn't exists add it. Add the related excercises to the Readme_cursor.md in excercise as well.
 Also, copy excercises of this part to /excercise/Readme.md same as the format that already exists in other parts

2- Skim/Read through the part/chapter

3- Run the excercises
