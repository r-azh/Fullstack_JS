NB: Because this is not a frontend project and we are not working with React, the application is not created with create vite@latest -- --template react. You initialize this project with the npm init command that was demonstrated earlier in this part of the material.

NB: Because the "node_modules" is created using "npm init", it will not be excluded when you are trying to add your code to git using "git add .", therefore please create a file called ".gitignore" and write "node_modules" so that git ignores it everytime you try to add, commit or push to a remote repo.

Strong recommendation: When you are working on backend code, always keep an eye on what's going on in the terminal that is running your application.

```shell
npm init
```
